# motd #

Git Repository: https://github.com/jasper9/puppet-motd

This is just a demo module, built copying puppetlabs/motd to demonstrate functionality.

I did add one nifty thing.  Install figlet [http://www.figlet.org/] on the puppetmaster (not the clients) and it will display the hostname in ascii.
